Rak GPS tracker was used for the poilot testing. [WisNode tracker](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisnode-trackit-set-rak2171?_pos=8&_sid=b75377cdd&_ss=r&variant=42255224045766) has dependable hardware and firmware, that is already compatible for the Helium network. This makes the on-boarding process easier during the testing phase. This tracker was distributed with the project team members who hiked the high difficulty trail as part of the poilot testing.

## Poilot Testing Area
