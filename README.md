Dangers of Breakneck Ridge
As a “landmark” site overlooking the Hudson River, the Breakneck Ridge Trail is very popular amongst hikers in the Metropolitan Area. In fact in 2018, it was noted by “trails.com” as the most popular day-hike in the United States. The steep hike also happens to be a relatively difficult one, and possesses many areas in which individuals want to explore “off-track.”

Lost and injured hikers on the ridge are unfortunately more common than one would expect. Broken ankles, sprains, bruises, etc. can be frequent and this is a great concern given the difficulty of the climb and descent. There have even been incidents of death, and so it is vital for the NYNJTC to continuously look for ways to make the available trails safer. They are often working on projects to make the trail safer, but also want to make sure individuals get emergency help as soon as possible, if need be.

In these drastic scenarios, it can become difficult to reach a hiker when the conditions are poor (rain, nighttime, etc). A cost issue with finding a lost or hurt individual is that police, the fire department, and medical services will likely all be needed during or after the rescue. It all-too-often happens in which the local fire department and EMT’s must be called in to help out. Being able to locate a hiker through a GPS tracker would limit this need, and providing location on trails should also keep hikers out of danger / areas in which they can get hurt and require medical attention.

## LoRaWAN Trackers as a Solution

The ability to provide a suitable mode to track inexperienced hikers in dangerous trails, such as Breakneck Ridge, would provide an effective way to ensure the safety of the hikers. Furthermore, a tracking solutions would reduce the rescue efforts upon the unfortunate incident of a lost hiker. Generally, for a tracking application such as this, there are few challenges that would need to be addressed. 

Challenges to deploy a tracking solution:
Coverage within the wilderness to pick up the tracker signal.
Convenient and scalable platform to get the trackers online and monitored.

Use of LoRaWAN(Long Range Wide Area Network) technology based trackers would allow overcoming some key challenges involved with a tracking deployment such as this. LoRaWAN has a longer reach of signals with a low power consumption for the transmission of data, due to the use of radio waves for communication. These technical advantages would allow overcoming the challenge of providing adequate coverage for trackers, which is the most crucial challenge that needs to be addressed. The presence of LoRaWAN networks such as Helium already in the region provides existing infrastructure to provide adequate coverage. The use of Helium LoRaWAN network along with the IoT Off-Grid firmware solutions could be used to develop a free to use tracking platform that is both convenient and scalable. This would afford a pathway to overcome the challenge of getting trackers online and monitoring.
