# Tech in Conservation(on-boarding)
This document details relavence of Internet of Things(IoT) to the sector of conservation, and what ways IoT devices can be used in the sector.

## IoT for Conservation

Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be used to assist in environmental conservation and forestry efforts by providing real-time data on a variety of factors. One key way that IoT is used in these contexts is through GPS tracking. For example, GPS tracking devices can be attached to wildlife in order to monitor their movements and understand their habitats better. This data can be used to develop conservation plans and to track the effectiveness of those plans over time. In the forestry sector, GPS tracking can be used to monitor the movement of logging equipment and to ensure that logging is being carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner. Additionally, IoT sensor networks can be used to monitor factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and air quality in forested areas, which can help with the detection of potential threats such as fires or pest infestations.

## IoT Applications Process

There are three main components in any IoT application. End-node/s component, LoRaWAN network and cloud component, and the data visualization dashboard component. Depending on the specific requirements of the conservation personnel or the organization, a set of sensors can be selected to create system that can monitor particular metrics at specified intervals. The sensor data are transmitted through LoRaWAN network(Eg- Helium, The THings Network, etc.) to the cloud. The data in the cloud are processed and develiered to a dashboard with preset specifications to be observed by the user.
