# Tech in Conservation(on-boarding)
This document details relavence of Internet of Things(IoT) to the sector of conservation, and what ways IoT devices can be used in the sector.

## IoT for Conservation

Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be used to assist in environmental conservation and forestry efforts by providing real-time data on a variety of factors. One key way that IoT is used in these contexts is through GPS tracking. For example, GPS tracking devices can be attached to wildlife in order to monitor their movements and understand their habitats better. This data can be used to develop conservation plans and to track the effectiveness of those plans over time. In the forestry sector, GPS tracking can be used to monitor the movement of logging equipment and to ensure that logging is being carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner. Additionally, IoT sensor networks can be used to monitor factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and air quality in forested areas, which can help with the detection of potential threats such as fires or pest infestations.

There are three main components in any IoT application. End-node/s component, LoRaWAN network and cloud component, and the data visualization dashboard component. Depending on the specific requirements of the conservation personnel or the organization, a set of sensors can be selected to create system that can monitor particular metrics at specified intervals. The sensor data are transmitted through LoRaWAN network(Eg- Helium, The Things Network, etc.) to the cloud. The data in the cloud are processed and develiered to a dashboard with preset specifications to be observed by the user. The aspect of the LoRaWAN netowrk and the dashboard can be made in generality, but for the sensor deployment, proper recognition of the measurement metric should be known. The identification of the most helpful metric could provide the best sensor selection and maximum use out of the deployed devices.

IoT sensors can be used in the detection and prevention of forest fires, as well as in monitoring the quality of water and air in forested areas. In terms of fire detection, IoT sensors can be placed in strategic locations throughout a forest to monitor for signs of a fire, such as changes in temperature or the presence of smoke. This data can then be analyzed in real-time, allowing for the rapid deployment of firefighting resources in the event of a blaze. Additionally, IoT sensors can be used to monitor water quality in a forest by measuring factors such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, and the presence of pollutants. This data can be used to identify potential issues and to take corrective action to preserve the health of the forest's water sources. Lastly, air quality in forested areas can be monitored with IoT sensors, by measuring parameters such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of pollutants. This data can be used to understand the potential impact of forest fires and other human activities on air quality, and to take the necessary measures to protect the environment.

## Environmental Management via IoT

Poor farming and land management practices can have a detrimental effect on the environment in a number of ways. One of the most significant impacts is the loss of biodiversity. Poor land management practices, such as overuse of fertilizers, pesticides and over-grazing by livestock, can lead to the degradation of the soil, which in turn can reduce the ability of the land to support a diverse range of plant and animal life. This loss of biodiversity can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem, as other species that rely on the plants and animals that have been lost can also be negatively impacted.

Another significant impact of poor farming and land management practices is water pollution. Runoff from farms can carry pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals into rivers and streams, leading to contamination of the water and the deaths of fish and other aquatic life. Additionally, poor land management can lead to soil erosion, which can cause sedimentation in bodies of water and contribute to the degradation of water quality.

Poor farming and land management practices can also contribute to air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases. The excessive use of fossil fuels and chemicals used in farming can increase the levels of carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Additionally, poor land management practices can lead to deforestation, which can exacerbate the effects of climate change by reducing the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Overall, poor farming and land management practices can have a significant negative impact on the environment by reducing biodiversity, contaminating water and air, and contributing to climate change. Effective land management practices are vital to preserve the soil and environment for the benefit of future generations.

IoT sensors can be used to improve farming and land management by providing real-time data on a variety of factors that affect crop growth and soil health. For example, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. This data can be used to optimize irrigation and to apply fertilizers and other inputs more efficiently. Additionally, IoT sensors can be used to track weather conditions and to predict the potential impact of weather events on crop growth. In precision agriculture, IoT sensors can be used in combination with satellite imagery and other technologies to create detailed, field-level maps of crop health, allowing farmers to identify issues and take corrective action more quickly.

In terms of land management, IoT sensor networks can be used to monitor factors such as air quality, water quality and soil moisture which in turn can indicate land degradation, this data can be used to identify areas that may be at risk and to take action to preserve the health of the land. Furthermore, in large farming land, IoT can be used to monitor the movement of farm equipment and to track the work of field hands to ensure that tasks are being carried out efficiently and effectively. IoT sensor also can be used to monitor live stock health and location by attaching GPS collars and other sensors, which can help farmers to optimize grazing and feed management.

Overall, IoT sensors have the potential to increase the efficiency and sustainability of farming and land management practices, by providing real-time data on key factors that affect crop growth and land health, which in-terms improves environmental quality.
