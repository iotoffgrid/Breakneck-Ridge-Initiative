Purchased from [Seeed studios](https://www.seeedstudio.com/WioField-Tester-Kit-p-5282.html?queryID=9791702fc87a7be285959c783545d776&objectID=5282&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products) comes with preloaded [firmware](https://github.com/disk91/WioLoRaWANFieldTester/) to allow mapping of Helium coverage. The field tester was powered with a 10Ah battery for extended hours of use. Device is taken on hikes into the areas of interest in the Hudson Highland State Park primarily forcused along the Breakneck Ridge trails.

## Area of Interest

Breakneck Ridge trail is located in the Hudson Highland State Park in New York. This area have a reasonable amount of hotspots scattered around and the primary objective was to validate the coverage of Helium on the trails based off the existing hotspots.

## Helium Coverage within the Trail Paths
The park itself was not mapped for Helium coverage and the mapping efforts for this project would be the first efforts to see the coverage in this state park. Below images depict the Helium coverage within the trails before and after the expiditions carried out by the IoT Off-Grid project crew.

A considerable amount of the major trails that are considered high difficulty have been covered through the mapping efforts as seen from the overlapping of the trail paths with respect to the coverage. The coverage of the trail with respect to the terrain can show impressive lorawan coverage given how animated the terrain is.
